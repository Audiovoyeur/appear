# [![appear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativelive/appear/master/assets/appear-32.png)] appear

**appear** tracks the visibility of dom elements and fires user defined callbacks when the appear and disappear from view.

## Usage

Include the appear.js in your page, it has no dependencies.

```
appear({
  // optional function to run when dom is interactive but appear.js has not yet started tracking items
  init: function init(){
    console.log('starting');
  },
  // either an htmlcollection or a function that returns an htmlcollection of items to track
  elements: function elements(){
    // for example, get all elements with the class "lazy"
    return document.getElementsByClassName('lazy');
  },
  // optional function to run when an element is in view, passed the element that has come into view
  // if defined then appear.js will track an item until it comes into view
  appear: function appear(el){
    console.log('visible', el);
  },
  // optional function to run when an element goes out of view, passed the element that has come into view
  // if defined then appear.js will track an item until it goes out of view
  disappear: function disappear(el){
    console.log('no longer visible', el);
  },
  // boolean, set to keep tracking an object for successfuive appears and dissappears, false by default
  reappear: true
  // optional increase to the threshold of the size of the element so it can be considered "viewable" before
  // it is actually in the viewport (default 200)
  bounds: 200,
  // appear.js tracks elements on browser scroll and resize, for performance reasons this check is "debounced" to
  // only happen once for multiple events, 50ms after the last event ends. You can override this value here.
  debounce: 50;
  // optional function called when appear.js is no longer tracking any items
  done: function done(){
    console.log('all done');
  }
});
```
